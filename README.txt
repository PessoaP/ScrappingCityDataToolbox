I present the python library ``Scrapping City Data Toolbox" (SCDT), which uses Foursquare places API (FSAPI) to obtain data of all Foursquare venues in a city.

The notebooks provides examples of usage. 
One needs a .geojson files (such as the ones obtained with Nominatim) for the algorithm to work.
 I've also pushed a report explaining in details a study done with SCDT for cities in the Americas.

The usage of the API is in accordance with Foursquare standards since the software is publically available. 
Also in  accordance to Foursquare standards the data is not available, however the notebooks explain how to obtain it.
