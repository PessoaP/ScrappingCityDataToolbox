I present the python library ``Scrapping City Data Toolbox" (SCDT), which uses Foursquare places API (FSAPI) to obtain data of all Foursquare venues in a city.

The notebooks provides examples of usage. But one needs .geojson files such as the ones found by Nominatim for the studied cities. I've also pushed a report explaining in details a study done with SCDT for American cities.

The usage of the API is in accordance with Foursquare standards since the software is publically available. However, the data is not available, however the notebooks explain how to obtain it.
