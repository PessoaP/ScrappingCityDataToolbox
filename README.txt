I present the python library ``Scrapping City Data Toolbox" (SCDT), which uses Foursquare places API (FSAPI) to obtain data of all Foursquare venues in a city.

The notebooks provide examples of usage. 
One needs a .geojson files (such as the ones obtained with Nominatim) for the algorithm to work.

Important files:

1- Using_SCDT.ipynb -- Gives an example of usage of the library, obtaining all the FS venues for a city.
2- report.pdf -- Presents the mathematical basis for the algorithms in SCDT and a study done with SCDT for cities in the Americas.

The usage of the API is in accordance with Foursquare standards since the software is publically available. 
Also in  accordance to Foursquare standards the data is not available, however the notebooks explain how to obtain it.
